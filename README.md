# hello-world

I am using git-hub as a repository for any Amazon Web Service coding that I might do, starting with various Alexa Skills.

I am developing the skills using AWS CLI and the Alexa SDK on a Macbook under Mac OS. Using Atom to edit the code with vim-plus, ex plugins and automatic git integration.
