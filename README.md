# hello-world

I am using git-hub as a repository for any Amazon Web Service coding that I might do, starting with various Alexa Skills.

I am developing the skills using AWS CLI and the Alexa SDK on a Macbook under Mac OS. Following the guide on Amazon.com (https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html) to install the relevant software:

  pip
  awscli (1.14.32)
  node.js (8.9.4)
  npm (5.6.0)
  ask-cli (1.1.0)
  

Using Atom (1.23.3) to edit the code with vim-mode-plus (1.27.0) , ex-mode (0.18.0) plugins and automatic git integration.
